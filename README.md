# üéÆ MyRPG (aka. MySolorRPG)

## Goal
Using the knowledge accumulated during the first year in graphic programming, create a complete RPG that we would be proud of.\
The project is to be done in groups of 4, during 1 month at the same time as the other projects of the school.

###### Re-uploaded after a *strange* ban from Google search...

## Reality

My group, despite my constant efforts to get them going and help them, did nothing during the entire project and barely managed to add anything on the night of the project's completion. (Which I removed from this repo because it was not implemented in the game).

I found myself with an unbearable workload on top of having to do my other projects.
Thanks to the enthusiasm I had at the beginning for the project, I coded most of the core elements of the game in a 'generic' way, which allowed me to quickly add features with a hammer towards the end of the project. But because of that, **I'm not proud of my code** even though I was careful at the beginning.

## Compilation (Linux)

#### Step 0 (Does not apply if you are an Epitech student)

You must install the CSFML library in order to compile.

#### Step 1

As some content of the game (sound, music, sprite...) are probably copyrighted, **you have to extract the data.zip archive in data**.
(If you are the copyright holder, please contact me, I will immediately remove your content)

#### Step 2

```shell
make
```
